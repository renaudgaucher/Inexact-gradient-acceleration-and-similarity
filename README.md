# From Inexact Gradients to Byzantine Robustness: Acceleration and Optimization under Similarity

Here are the code used to simeulate the experiments in our ICML 2026 submission. 
To reproduce the experiments, please iteratively run

    > python experiments_minist_logreg_short_iid_heter.py
    > python analysis_short.py
    > python experiments_mnist_logreg_longrun.py
    > python analysis_long.py

the plots should be available in the folder 'results'
